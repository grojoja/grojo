# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating pluses, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each plus/how to easily place plus on screen in an algorithmic way.
If you did not implement tesselation, please try to come up with an algorithmic approach to place pluses on the screen. This means a strategy, pseudocode, or even actual code! 
Consider the `HexWorld` implementation provided near the end of the lab (within the lab video). Note that `HexWorld` was the lab assignment from a previous semester (in which students drew hexagons instead of pluses). 
How did your proposed implementation/algorithm differ from the given one (aside from obviously hexagons versus pluses) ? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:  
My proposed implementation and algorithm ran a lot slower than it should have actually been. I found that my idea eventually just had a lot of unnecessary code that did things that I could already assume would not occur 
in my code whatsoever. I learned that the simplest approach is most likely the solution, as it has been with all of the projects so far.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating pluses and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the plus and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
I think the analogy between the two processes is that making the hallways and rooms is just creating more of the pluses and tesselations.
I think that the plus is the creation of the room, and the tesselation is the creation of the hallways. We just need to connect them.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating pluses.**

Answer:
I think that the method I would start on first would just be addPlus because this would be the most important step in building anything in this project.
I think that just understanding this would help me develop more methods to create more rooms and hallways.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**
I think that what distinguishes a room from a hallway is a hallway is basically a room but longer, and a room is
more likely to have different and separate connections. I think they are similar because they still use the same tile rendering
and development algorithms.
